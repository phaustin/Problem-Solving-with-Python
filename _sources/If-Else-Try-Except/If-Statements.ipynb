    "The keyword ```if``` begins the statement. Following ```if```, a logical condition must to be included. A logical condition is an variable or expression that can be evaluated as ```True``` or ```False```. An example of a logical condition is ```a<5```. The logical condition ```a<5``` returns ```True``` if ```a``` is less than 5. Otherwise, if ```a``` is 5 or greater ```a<5``` returns ```False```. Following the logical condition, a colon ```:``` is required. After the if-statement, a section of code to run when the condition is ```True``` is included. The section of ```<code to run>``` must be indented and every line in this section of code must be indented the same number of spaces. By convention, four space indentation is used in Python. Most Python code editors, including Jupyter notebooks, indent code after if-statements automatically four spaces. \n",
